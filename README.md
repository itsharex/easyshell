# EasyShell

**AI-Native Server Operations Platform**

Let AI write your scripts, orchestrate multi-host tasks, and analyze your infrastructure — while you focus on what matters.

## Why EasyShell?

Traditional server management tools expect you to write every script, SSH into every box, and interpret every output yourself. EasyShell flips that model: **AI is the operator, you are the decision-maker.**

- **Describe what you need in plain language** → AI writes production-ready shell scripts with diff review
- **Set a goal across multiple hosts** → AI plans the execution steps, runs them, and synthesizes the results
- **Connect via Web SSH** → Full terminal with file manager, multi-tab, search — no local client needed

---

## Core Features

### 1. AI Script Assistant

> Describe what you want. AI writes the script. Review the diff. One click to apply.

The AI Script Workbench is a split-panel editor where you describe requirements in natural language, and AI generates (or modifies) shell scripts targeting your chosen OS. Real-time streaming shows the script being written. A built-in diff view highlights exactly what changed. A summary tab explains the modifications in your language.

</p>

### 2. AI Task Orchestration

> "Check disk and memory on all hosts, flag anything over 80%, and suggest fixes." — Done.

The AI Chat interface lets you issue high-level operational goals. AI decomposes them into a multi-step execution plan (explore → analyze → report), dispatches scripts to target hosts, collects results, and delivers a structured analysis with risk assessment and actionable recommendations — all in a single conversation turn.

</p>

### 3. Fully Functional Web SSH

> Real terminal. Real file manager. No SSH client required.

A production-grade web terminal with multi-tab sessions, integrated file manager (upload, download, create, delete, navigate), full-text search within terminal buffer, and persistent connections via WebSocket. Manage files and run commands side by side.

</p>

### 4. Host Management & Monitoring

> Unified view of all servers with real-time status, batch operations, and agent lifecycle management.

Manage hosts individually or in bulk — add via form or CSV import, organize into clusters, monitor connection status, and deploy/upgrade agents with one click. The unified dashboard shows health metrics at a glance.

</p>

### 5. Real-Time Streaming Logs

> Watch script execution unfold live across all target hosts.

When you dispatch a script, EasyShell streams output from every agent in real time. Color-coded logs, timestamps, and per-host filtering help you spot issues instantly — no more waiting for batch jobs to complete.

</p>

### 6. Security & Risk Controls

> Built-in safeguards: approval workflows, audit trails, and operation restrictions.

Configure which operations require approval before execution. All actions are logged for compliance. Role-based access control limits who can do what, and sensitive commands can be flagged or blocked entirely.

## AI-Powered Automated Inspections

> **Cron → Script → AI Analysis → Bot Notification** — fully automated, zero human intervention.

Schedule inspection tasks with cron expressions. EasyShell dispatches scripts to agents, collects output (disk, memory, services, logs), sends it to your AI model for intelligent analysis, and pushes the report to your team via bot channels.

**How it works:**
1. **Configure** — cron expression + shell script + AI analysis prompt
2. **Execute** — EasyShell dispatches to target agents on schedule
3. **Analyze** — Output sent to AI model (OpenAI / Gemini / GitHub Copilot / Custom)
4. **Notify** — Report pushed to bot channel (Telegram, Discord, Slack, DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom)

**Supported Bot Channels** ([Configuration Guide](https://docs.easyshell.ai/configuration/bot-channels/)):

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/easyshell-ai/easyshell.git
cd easyshell
cp .env.example .env      # Edit .env if needed
docker compose up -d
```

No local build required — pre-built images are pulled automatically from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/laolupaojiao).

Open `http://localhost:18880` → login with `easyshell` / `easyshell@changeme`.
